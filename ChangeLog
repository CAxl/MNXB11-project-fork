	Commits on Oct 26, 2025: 
		Added a separate dataset ice_cream.csv
	Commits on Oct 27, 2025: 
		Wrote a reader function for ice_cream.csv
			* reader stores comma-separated cols in std::vectors in a struct IceCreamData
		Removed .csv file from git (local only)
		Wrote my own reader for SMHI datasets to extract bara-data into struct TemperatureData
			* Wrote computeMonthlyTemp() to average temp readings over month so that temp monthly corresp to ice_cream (months)
	Commits on Oct 29, 2025:
		Implemented plot function() for datasets
			* first a plotTempOnly() to see if it works, and to learn ROOT
			* finally a plotTempVsSales() to plot both in the same canvas
	Commits on Oct 30, 2025:
		Refactored computeMonthlyTemp() and plotTempVsSales() to align with repo workflow, using the existing Measurement class and read_measurements() instead of my separate temperature reader
			* i.e., passing std::vector\<Measurement\> instead of std::string filename to my functions
		Implemented gPad to plot on a double axis
	Commits on Oct 30, 2025:
		Buggfixing alignment issues between ice_cream months and temp months
		(still not 100% satisfied)
