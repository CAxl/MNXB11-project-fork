* Added changelog updates

2025-10-30
* Finalized the creation of void function  tempReader 

2025-10-29
* Fixed compilation issue with g++ by adding an exception for error codes in DataExtraction.cxx

2025-10-23
* Added the first iteration of a function tempReader which reads the TTree created from the persist_measurement function and returns a histogram with the mean temperatures each year for a dataset.

2025-10-22
* Created a class called Measurement which can store the measurements from the datafiles, along with Get-functions to access them. Created two functions. One called read_measurements for filling a vector of the object type Measurement with all data from the datafiles. The other function, persist_measurements, takes the vector of object type Measurement and creates a TTree with branches filled with data, which can later be used in analysis.
